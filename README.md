 Lab 13: INSTRUCTIONS
Take the JSON payload available from /r/aww (check
with the instructor before using anything else) and
use the data to create a “feed”.
1. Break into small groups and delegate tasks.
2. Look at the raw JSON to see how objects are
organized.
3. Create a webpage that pulls information from the
payload.
